Firebase Setup Commands
=======================

Run these commands in PowerShell (one at a time):

1. Add paths and navigate to project:
   $env:Path += ";$env:APPDATA\npm;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin"
   cd C:\xampp2\htdocs\IRTA_Forms\irta_forms_app

2. Login to Firebase (opens browser):
   firebase login

3. Configure FlutterFire (after login completes):
   flutterfire configure

4. After flutterfire configure completes, update lib/main.dart:
   - Uncomment: import 'firebase_options.dart';
   - Uncomment: await Firebase.initializeApp(...);

5. Enable services in Firebase Console:
   - Authentication > Sign-in method > Enable Email/Password
   - Firestore Database > Create database > Test mode
   - Storage > Get started > Test mode

Alternative: If you want to run the script, first run:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
   Then run: .\setup_firebase.ps1
